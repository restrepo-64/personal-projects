## BAT & VBS

### CLOSETASK.BAT
  opens and closes an application for implementing in automation tasks, with goofy confirmation dialogs to confirm reaching completion.

### systeminfotest.bat
  grabs specific system info from computer itself without having to dig through settings or GUI

### testfindprocess.vbs
  finds if an application is running on the computer currently

** **all of these are  meant for automation purposes to save time for the user navigating through multiple GUI's and settings** **
