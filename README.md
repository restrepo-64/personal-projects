# personal-projects
personal projects I did at home as well as projects I did at work to assist with automation and to streamline work processes

## Jarvis-Prototype (Name TBD) ##
  **Language: Powershell**
  chatbot-style project that can play games with you, answer questions, and give information pulling from various APIs
  
## Pokemon API Play ##
  **Language: Powershell**
  Need to rename project name to reflect scope, but purpose is to help automate using every Pokémon, but not repeating any, to "catch them all" in a current art project
  Script will connect to Pokémon API, pull random name from list of all Pokémon, check a local text file(pokemonlistused.txt) to see if the Pokémon has already been used, and if not, present the mon to the user
  
## Shortcut Command on Desktop Shutdown Not Hybrid Sleep ##
  As Windows defaults to shut down into a hybrid sleep mode, I created this shortcut to fully shut down my computer as needed without opening terminal to type the command in myself

## What Game to Play ##
  **Language: Powershell**
  Chatbot program that helps the user to choose a game to play dependent on category. Not a complete list of games.
