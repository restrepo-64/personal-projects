## Cookie Clicker Game Code
  These code snips control the mechanics of a cookie clicker game I am currently working on. 
  
  Mechanics include buying and selling cookies with a cash counter, hiring bakers that can auto-create cookies, as well as shops that can auto-sell cookies.
  A disaster system also is implemented to where randomly cookies will be lost due to a "bakery fire"
